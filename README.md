# **Artificial neural network in keras**

I work on a artificial neural network to classify roses and 
sunflowers. It was developed in Keras, this is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. 

The dataset used belongs to Kaggle, an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, to access click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
